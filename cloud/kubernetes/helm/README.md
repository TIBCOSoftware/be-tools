# Introduction

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications. Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy simple or complex applications.

This chart installs Business Events application deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster.
