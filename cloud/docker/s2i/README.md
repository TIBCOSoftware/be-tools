# Introduction

<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/creating_images/s2i.html">Openshift's Source-to-Image (S2I)</a> is a framework for building reproducible container images making it super easy for developers to provide application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.


TIBCO Business Events's S2I support allows users to create a reusable builder image while the developer can provide end application source code (via ear & cdd) to create and run the assembled image.
