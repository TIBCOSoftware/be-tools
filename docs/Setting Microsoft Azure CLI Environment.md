# Setting up the Microsoft Azure CLI Environment

You can use either the Microsoft Azure Cloud Shell or Microsoft Azure command-line interface \(CLI\) for running the Microsoft Azure commands. In the following sections, the procedures are provided for the Azure CLI.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with an active subscription. If required, [create a new Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

1.  Install the Microsoft Azure command-line interface \(CLI\). For installation instructions, see [Microsoft Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)

2.  In Microsoft Azure CLI, sign in to Microsoft Azure by using the `login` command.

    ```
    az login
    ```

    The CLI opens a browser and loads the sign-in page.

3.  Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

    For details, see [Get started with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
