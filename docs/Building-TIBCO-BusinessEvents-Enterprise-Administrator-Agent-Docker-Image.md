TIBCO BusinessEvents provides script files to build TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent Docker image by using bundled Dockerfiles.

You can build the Docker image either by using existing TIBCO BusinessEvents installation \(`BE_HOME`\) from your computer or by using the software installer of TIBCO BusinessEvents and other required products. The Docker image generated by using software installers is of smaller size in comparison to the Docker image generated by using your TIBCO BusinessEvents installation.

### Prerequisites

See [Preparing for TIBCO BusinessEvents Containerization](Before%20You%20Begin#preparing-for-tibco-businessevents-containerization)

## Procedure

- **Docker Image by Using Software Installers**

  Go to the `BE_HOME/cloud/docker/bin` folder and run the `build_teagent_image` TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent Docker image building script.

  **Syntax**:

  ```
  build_teagent_image -l <installers-directory> [-r <teagent-image-name>:<teagent-image-version>] [-d <Dockerfile>] [-h]
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```
  build_teagent_image -l /home/user/tibco/installers
  ```

- **\(*Linux Only*\) Docker Image by Using Existing TIBCO BusinessEvents Installation**

  Go to the `BE_HOME/cloud/docker/bin/frominstall` folder and run the `build_teagent_image` TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent Docker image building script.

  **Syntax**:

  ```
  build_teagent_image [-l <BE_HOME-location>] [-r <teagent-image-name>:<teagent-image-version>] [-d <Dockerfile>] [-h]
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```
  build_teagent_image -r teagent-be:1.0
  ```

**Note:** For the Windows platform, enclose all arguments in double quotes \("\).

| Argument                                                     | Required/Optional | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-l/--installers-location` \(*For the Docker image based on software installers*\) | Required          | The location where installers for TIBCO BusinessEvents, TIBCO ActiveSpaces, and TIBCO BusinessEvents add-ons \(optional\) are stored. This option is available for scripts that are run from BE_HOME/cloud/docker/bin. |
| `-l/--be-home` \(*For the Docker image based on the existing TIBCO BusinessEvents installation*\) | Optional          | Specify TIBCO BusinessEvents installation \(BE_HOME\) location. This is optional if the script runs from its default location \(BE_HOME/cloud/docker/frominstall\). |
| `-r/--repo`                                                  | Optional          | Name that you want to assign to the TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent Docker image. Optionally, you can provide the version number for the Docker image. Use the following naming convention for the TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent Docker image: `<image-name>:[version-number]` For example, `teagent:1.0`. The default value is `teagent:<BE_version>`. For example, for version 5.6.1 of TIBCO BusinessE bvents, the default value is `teagent:5.6.1`. |
| `-d/--dockerfile`                                            | Optional          | The custom Dockerfile to be used for generating image. You can use your own Dockerfile or you can edit and use the Dockerfile provided with the TIBCO BusinessEvents installation. If you have placed the Dockerfile at a location other than the default location, provide the path of the Dockerfile. If not specified, the script uses the default bundled Dockerfile. For list of default Dockerfiles for the scripts provided with TIBCO BusinessEvents, see [Dockerfile for TIBCO BusinessEvents](Dockerfile%20for%20TIBCO%20BusinessEvents). |
| `-h/--help`                                                  | Optional          | Provides help for the script file.                           |
