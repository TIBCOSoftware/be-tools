# Introduction

[Openshift's Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/creating_images/s2i.html) is a framework for building reproducible container images making it super easy for developers to provide application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.


TIBCO Business Events's S2I support allows users to create a reusable builder image while the developer can provide end application source code (via ear & cdd) to create and run the assembled image.


## Prerequisites

* [Openshift S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)


## Getting Started

Should be fairly straightforward. Lets start off with creating a reusable builder image.
``` 
./create_builder_image.sh -l

where,
[-l|--installers-location] : Location where TIBCO BusinessEvents and other required installers are located [required] 
[-d|--docker-file] : Dockerfile to be used for generating image.(default Dockerfile) [optional]
[--gv-providers] : Names of GV providers to be included in the image. Supported value(s) - consul [optional]"
[-r|--repo] : The builder image Repository (example - s2ibuilder:latest) [required]"
[-h|--help] : Print the usage of script [optional]"

Using Business Events v5.6.0 for this example,
./create_builder_image.sh -l /Users/test/BE_Installers -r s2ibuilder:01

```
Next we provide application source to s2i to create an assembled image off the previously created builder image.
```

syntax: 

s2i build <location of the source code> <name of the builder image> <name of the application image>

Using FraudDetection application for this example,
example: 

s2i build /Users/test/Applications/FraudDetection/source s2ibuilder:01 fdopenshifts2i:01
```

Finally run the application,

```
docker run -p 8108:8108 fdopenshifts2i:01
```

At any point to check how to use this, simply run the `usage` command

```
s2i usage
```

## Limitation

Currently s2i does not support windows containers. Refer to this github issue <a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/issues/991">991</a> for more details.
