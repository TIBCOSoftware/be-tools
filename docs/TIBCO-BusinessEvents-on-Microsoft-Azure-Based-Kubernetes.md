# TIBCO BusinessEvents on Microsoft Azure Based Kubernetes

You can run any TIBCO BusinessEvents application on Microsoft Azure based Kubernetes cluster and monitor them by using TIBCO BusinessEvents Enterprise Administrator Agent. You can also manage business rules through WebStudio by running RMS on Microsoft Azure based Kubernetes cluster.

Microsoft Azure provides two storage options for persistent volumes:

-   *Azure Disks* - available for access to single node with the ReadWriteOnce privilege.
-   *Azure Files* - available for access to multiple nodes and pods.

For more information about Kubernetes concepts and Microsoft Azure, see [Azure Kubernetes Service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/).
